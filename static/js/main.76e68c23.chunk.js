The case study centers on  architecting an adaptable delivery network consisting of routing for each plant-dealer-vehicle combination. After visualizing and exploring the datasets given to us, we concluded the best approach would be to frame the problem as an integer linear program; to increase the computational feasibility of this continuous optimization task, we used clustering to group dealerships and create smaller sub-problems.
